# XeroLinux "G" ISO Repo

Repo for **XeroLinux-G** ISO. Feel free to go through files and learn how it's all done. To build ISO need to use **ABS** Script via commands below, and **DO NOT** install ian a VM yet there's an issue with *Mutter* & latest *mesa* drivers, waiting for a fix upstream. ;)

```
cd ~ && git clone https://github.com/xerolinux/xero_g_iso
cd ~/xero_iso/ && abs XeroG
```

### Note
> This here, is a side project, as a result, it will only be updated every Major release of GNOME. This uses R43.1 so next release will be once R44.1 lands sometime in March 2023...
