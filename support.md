<h1 align="center">Why am I charging for FOSS stuff?</h1>

A lot of people complain about why I'm charging for stuff that are **FOSS**. Simple and straightforward answer, **`I'm Not`**.

I'm charging for the **time, work and efforts** I put in creating those amazing stuff **`for you`**.

_`Why though?`_ My country, **(Lebanon)** is currently going through a bad economic & political crisis. In light of the current situation, maintaining the project, or at least any extra ones, pro-bono, is getting harder than it should be. Your contributions will go a long way into sustaining it for a long time to come.

As a person who loves `Linux`, I share those things with you, So you can take _inspiration_ and try to create your own, So that you can **learn**. Not because I want an audience to buy my stuff. I don't like to do that, but due to my current situation, without a job to feed myself, or pay the outstanding monthly bills, I have no choice.

It's not like I do not offer a free way to grab this and any future projects I work on. I am giving you 2 choices, either support me to get a pre-built ISO by joining the $25 **Patreon** Tier, or get it for **FREE** by following a simple guide I have painstakingly put together. Simple as that.

And all the money I get from this, Will eventually be invested in a **Free and Open Source Project, [XeroLinux](https://xerolinux.xyz/)**. Which I've created and maintain all alone.

### Also, Why should I not charge?

Let me tell you why... I'm a `KDE Plasma` user, I have been using it for almost 3 years till date. I don't use anything else. But I have created this and will make others in the future *as you keep asking me* to, **`Kind of demanded`**. Like do this and do that.

I understand, there are many other and in most cases better and **Free** choices out there. But you came here for a reason. You like my work. Also consider that I am a one man show, not a _Company_ with a huge team and income or contributions from the likes of **Microsoft** / **Redhat** or others. I need to sustain myself and my projects...

**- Consider this...**

First, let me be clear, I am not as well known as many other projects out there. As a result I am not getting as many downloads as I would hope. With that in mind...

Assume working for **15USD an hour** (lowest) for **8 hours** (regular 9to5 job) which is currently not possible due to economic crisis. And if it takes **`7 days`** to build a Distro with a DE/WM (_trust me it takes that much time when you do everything from scratch_), You should be getting **`15x8x7 = 840 USD`**. I put a **25USD tag** on this Edition and others I will potentially be working on. Even if **20** people purchase it, a dream as of now, I still get **500 USD** (**275 USD** actually after Taxes & other charges). Dude I'm not getting half of the actual work I've done.

**FOSS** doesn't mean `FREE OF COST`. It means **`Freedom`** to choose. So you're free to choose either my stuff or other stuff.

> **`Yes, I'm a FOSS maintainer and I charge for my time, work and efforts. That's it.`**

Thank you for understanding. I don't mean to be harsh, but unfortunately that's the reality, and it can be hard at times.
